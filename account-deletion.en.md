# Account and Data Deletion (ThesisAudit)

Last updated: 2026-02-10

## How to delete your account in the app
Account deletion is available directly in the app:

1) Open the side menu  
2) Tap **Settings**  
3) On the settings screen, tap **Delete account**  
4) Confirm deletion of all data

After confirmation, the account is deleted and the user’s data is removed from our systems.

## What data is deleted
When you delete your account, we delete all user-related data, including:
- account data (e.g., email address);
- user-uploaded materials/files and processing results;
- related records and technical identifiers required for the app to function.

## Deletion timeline
Deletion is performed after user confirmation.  
(If you use backups: specify how long backups may be retained and that they are overwritten on a rolling basis.)

## If you cannot delete the account in the app
Email us from the address associated with the account:

**Support email:** dojo4educationreport@gmail.com
Subject: **Account deletion request**

Include your account email address and a request to delete the account and all associated data.
